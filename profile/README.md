Real-Space Density Functional Theory at JÃ¼lich Supercomputing Centre

 - AngstromCube: a DFT package for all-electron real-space grid DFT using PAW and tfQMRgpu as Green function solver
 - tfQMRgpu: a GPU library to accelerate linear system solves allowing block-sparsity
 - juRS (archived): a CPU code written in modern Fortran for massively parallel real-space grid DFT loading PAW potentials
